However, I deepened my understanding in Analysis and Systems Development through comprehensive online courses and university studies. Consequently, I acquired skills in applying the Java language for SQL database manipulation, including CRUD operations. I can confidently state that my focus has now shifted to back-end development. Java was my inaugural programming language, and currently, I am directing my studies towards Angular, Spring, and SAP.",
